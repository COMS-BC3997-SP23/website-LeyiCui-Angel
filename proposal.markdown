## Motivations

Human movements are very complicated, especially when it comes to dance movements. Dancers easily get injured because of the limited help they can get when they are practicing. Besides, computational analysis of dance movements is still rather limited. Concise capture technologies for human movements are mostly high-cost motion-capturing facilities that are less accessible for dancers in their day-to-day training. Thus, in this research project, I want to explore possible technologies to capture human movements more concisely through web-cam or movement animations.

## Goals

At this phase of the research, I have the following goals:

1. Through literature reviews, categorize currently existing technologies for motion capturing (computer vision, video-to-motion robotics machine learning).
2. Find a gap or an interesting project to work on.

At the end of the semester, the research should reach the following goals:

1. Reimplement or develop technology for motion capturing.
2. Develop a thorough report that consists of works done for this research throughout the semester.

## Methods

Computer vision, robotics, machine learning
