## Possible direction of work

### Webcam movement capture
#### Pros
1. Cheap: dancers can open their laptop, open the website.
2. User friendly: just online interface.
#### Cons
1. 2D image: do we need 3D capture to analysis dance movement?
2. Very simple Matchstick Men style animation: not accurate enough. Done some work with it but the results are not very satisfying.
3. Not an open ground for work? Will be technically hard.

### Sensors
#### Pros
1. Accurate
#### Cons
1. Expensive? Can use cheap sensors
2. Not an open ground for work?
3. Personally not very familiar with hardwares.

### Machine learning models with camera
#### Pros
1. Many options. Might need camera that could capture different depth? Might need more than one camera?
2. Existing work is helpful: VIBE: Video Inference for Human Body Pose and Shape Estimation
#### Cons
1. Might be expensive.
